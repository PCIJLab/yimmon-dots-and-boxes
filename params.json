{"name":"Dots-and-Boxes","tagline":"A simple Dots and Boxes AI.","body":"<h1>Qdab</h1>\r\nQdab is a simple Dots and Boxes AI. It is written in golang and python2.7. The basic idea is straightforward, UCT plus ANN.<br />\r\nQdab can reach a high level. I compared Qdab with dabble.exe(http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~jpg/dabble/) and PRsBoxes.exe(http://www.dianneandpaul.net/PRsBoxes/), the result is Qdab won them in most cases.\r\n\r\n<h1>Running</h1>\r\nI have compiled Qdab for Windows and Linux users, please download correct version before running. You can find it in directory <b>release</b>.<br/>\r\n\r\n<b>Note: Please make sure you have seen \"Server is running at 127.0.0.1:12345\" after run Qdab and before any other operation.</b>\r\n\r\n<h2>Windows</h2>\r\nUncompress the .zip file, and double click <b>Qdab.bat</b>. \r\n\r\n<h2>Linux</h2>\r\nFirst, make sure you have already installed python2.7, gtk, and python-simplejson in your computer.<br />\r\nSecond, uncompress the .tar.bz2 file and make Qdab.sh executable.<br />\r\nFinally, go to the directory containing Qdab.sh, run <b>./Qdab.sh</b>.\r\n\r\n<h1>Screenshot</h1>\r\n<img src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/3c1d8fab59aed7c0175f8a982280ea5265f7c633/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f4b7270346838392e706e67\" />\r\n\r\n<h1>Compilation</h1>\r\nIf you are interested in this program, you can make some changes and compile your version.<br />\r\nFor Linux:<br />\r\n1. Install FANN 2.2.0 and golang1.2.2 (must be version 1.2), the setup files are in directory env, and configure your Go environment.<br />\r\n2. Run the <b>./install.sh</b> to compile all modules whith will make directory bin.<br />\r\n3. Simply copy directory <b>AnnModel</b> from my release version to your directory ./bin or train your own ANN models, to get it you need to understand my code.<br />\r\n4. The binary file needed to run Qdab is <b>./bin/server</b> and <b>./src/guiclient/guiclient.py</b>, please note `pwd` must be directory bin when you run the server.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
