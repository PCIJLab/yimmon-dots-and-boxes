Qdab
==============
Qdab is a simple Dots and Boxes AI. It is written in golang and python2. The basic idea is straightforward, UCT plus ANN.
Qdab can reach a high level. I compared Qdab with dabble.exe(http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~jpg/dabble/) and PRsBoxes.exe(http://www.dianneandpaul.net/PRsBoxes/), the result is Qdab won them in most cases.

Running
